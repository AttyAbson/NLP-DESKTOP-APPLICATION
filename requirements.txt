# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Basic installation:
#    pip install pyqt5 torch transformers requests beautifulsoup4 fake-useragent numpy scipy tokenizers nltk textstat langdetect
#
# 2. For better performance, also install:
#    pip install accelerate sentencepiece sacremoses
#
# 3. For advanced NLP features:
#    pip install spacy textblob vaderSentiment
#    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# New Models Information:
# ========================
# Sentiment Analysis Models (will auto-download ~500-800MB total):
# - j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base (~300MB)
# - SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions (~500MB) 
# - michellejieli/emotion_text_classifier (~250MB)
#
# Spam Detection Models (will auto-download ~400-600MB total):
# - deepset/deberta-v3-base-injection (~400MB)
# - ealvaradob/bert-finetuned-phishing (~280MB)
# - Hate-speech-CNERG/dehatebert-mono-english (~440MB)
#
# Total first-time download: ~1-1.5GB
# Subsequent runs: Models cached locally, no re-download needed
#
# System Requirements:
# - RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
# - Storage: 3GB free space for models and cache
# - Internet: Required for initial model downloads
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - If models fail to download, the app will use enhanced rule-based detection
# - For slow internet, models download sequentially with progress indication
# - Models are cached in: ~/.cache/huggingface/transformers/
# - To clear model cache: Delete the cache folder above

# Platform-specific notes:
# Windows: Ensure Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is installed
# macOS: May need to install Xcode command line tools
# Linux: Usually works out of the box

# Emoji Support:
# Windows: Windows Key + . (period)
# macOS: Control + Command + Space  
# Linux: Depends on desktop environment
